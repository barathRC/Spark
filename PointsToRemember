SPARK CLUSTER ABD RUNTIME ARCHITECTURE

Spark is a distributed cluster in-memory parallel processing framework
Spark application is also distributed (driver JVM app and executor JVM app)

Pyspark is a wrapper around Java wrapper inturn around spark core which is coded in Scala which runs on JVM
Pyspark driver main() connects with JVM application driver main() with Py4j
Scala directly JVM application driver

When you do a spark submit, the RM (YARN) will spin up an Application Master(AM) in one of the worker node (4core 16GB RAM out of 16core 64GB RAM worker node)
AM requests YARN RM to provision Executor containers. RM provisions the required Exec containers by spinning up them in the worker nodes 
and providing them to the driver
